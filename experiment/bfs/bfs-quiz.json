Assuming the hero can only move up, down, left and/or right to the immediately adjacent cells and cannot move out of the grid, how many steps will it take for the hero to reach the villain (given that the villain is stationary)?",

This problem can be remodeled as a problem to find the shortest distance from the root to a specific node where the hero\u2019s starting cell is the root and the graph is formed by taking vertically and horizontally adjacent cells to be connected by edges.
