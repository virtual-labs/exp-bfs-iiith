            "question": "1. Which of the following is a use of the extra \u2018visited\u2019 array (the array used to keep track of which nodes have been visited/traversed) in BFS?",
            "answers": {
                "a": "To avoid getting stuck in a cycle",
                "b": "To decide which node to traverse next",
                "c": "To preemptively end the algorithm when all nodes are marked as visited thus saving time",

            "correctAnswer": "a",
            "explanations": {
                "a": "The \u2018visited\u2019 array is checked each time we find a child of some vertex in the queue. If the child node has been marked as visited, it means we have visited that node before and hence do not add it to the queue thus avoiding getting stuck in a cycle.",
                "b": "This is decided by the queue itself and not the visited array. Whichever node is at the front of the queue is the node that is traversed next.",
                "c": "The \u2018visited\u2019 array is not needed to perform this as when we mark a node as visited, we also pop/remove that node from the queue. Thus, when the last node is marked as visited, it is also popped making the queue empty and the algorithm automatically stops.",

            "question": "2. What would happen if we used a stack instead of a queue in BFS?",
            "answers": {
                "a": "The algorithm would simply traverse the graph in the reverse order, i.e, from bottom to top (leaves to root)",
                "b": "The algorithm would become equivalent to DFS",
                "c": "The algorithm would not work properly, i.e, it will not traverse the graph properly and/or completely",
                "d": "No change in the algorithm, i.e, it remains unaffected"
            },
            "correctAnswer": "b",
            "explanations": {
                "a": "This would not happen. A stack follows the FIFO (first in, first out) policy. When we use a stack, the order of traversal would change but not so much that we go from bottom to top. We would still move from top to bottom (root to leaves).",
                "b": "This is the right answer as what would happen is that we would keep popping/traversing the latest node from the stack. Thus, we would keep traversing a specific branch of the graph until we reach the leaves and then move on to the next closest branch which is what DFS does.",
                "c": "The algorithm will still traverse the graph completely. The only change will be in the order of traversal.",
                "d": "There is a significant change in the order of traversal such that the logic of the algorithm itself changes."
